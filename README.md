# Kubernetes Autoscaling, using Deep Reinforcement Learning
In this project a different scaling approach is proposed. This method combines RL and KEDA in order to create a scaler simmilar to HPA. 
This is a study that compares cpu HPA scalers and RL scalers. The goal is to find the optimal solution!
